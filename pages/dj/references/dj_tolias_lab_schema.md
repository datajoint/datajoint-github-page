# Download

You can download the schemas from [github repository](https://github.com/atlab/commons).

# Description

The [github repository](https://github.com/atlab/commons) contains the public portions of DataJoint schemas for basic processing data
from neuroscience experiments that are shared between several members of Andreas Tolias' lab.

Each schema may contain additional classes that are not included in this public repository
but may show up in some ERDs (entity relationship diagrams).

DataJoint was initially developed in 2009 by `Dimitri Yatsenko`_ in Andreas Tolias' Lab at Baylor College of Medicine for the distributed processing and management of large volumes of data streaming from ongoing experiments. Starting in 2011, DataJoint has been available as an open-source project adopted by other labs and substantially improved with  contributions from `Andreas Hoenselaar`_ (CalTech), `Alex Ecker`_ (Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics), `Edgar Walker`_ (Baylor College of Medicine), and `Fabian Sinz`_ (Baylor College of Medicine) . DataJoint was inspired in part by an earlier database tool called Steinbruch developed by `Alex Ecker`_ and `Philipp Berens`_.
